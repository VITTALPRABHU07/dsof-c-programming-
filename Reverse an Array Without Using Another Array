# Reverse an Array Without Using Another Array (C Program)

Overview

This program reverses the elements of an array **in-place**, meaning **without using any additional array**. The reversal is done by swapping elements from the beginning and end of the array.

This is a very important program for **understanding array manipulation**, **two-pointer technique**, and is frequently asked in **C programming labs and interviews**.

 Algorithm (In-Place Reversal)

1. Read the number of elements `n`.
2. Read `n` elements into the array.
3. Initialize two indices:

   * `start = 0`
   * `end = n - 1`
4. While `start < end`:

   * Swap `arr[start]` and `arr[end]`
   * Increment `start`
   * Decrement `end`
5. Print the reversed array.


 Program Logic

* No extra array is used.
* Only a temporary variable is used for swapping.
* The array is reversed in the same memory location.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1) (Constant extra space)

Input

* Number of elements in the array
* Elements of the array (integers)

Example Input

```
5
10 20 30 40 50
```

---

Output

* Array elements in reverse order

Example Output
Reversed array:
50 40 30 20 10
