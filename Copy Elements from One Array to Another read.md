# Copy Elements from One Array to Another (C Program)

Overview

This program copies elements from one array into another array using the C programming language. Each element of the source array is copied to the destination array using a loop.
This is a basic and important program for understanding **array traversal** and **memory handling** in C. It is commonly asked in **lab exams and interviews**.

Algorithm

1. Read the number of elements `n`.
2. Declare two arrays of size `n`.
3. Read `n` elements into the first array.
4. Use a `for` loop to copy each element from the first array to the second array.
5. Print the elements of the copied array.

Program Logic

* Element-by-element copying is done using a loop.
* Both arrays contain the same elements after copying.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

 Input

* Number of elements in the array
* Elements of the array (integers)

Example Input

```
4
10 20 30 40
```

---

 Output

* Displays the elements of the copied array

 Example Output

```
The elements of the copied array are:
10
20
30
40
```
