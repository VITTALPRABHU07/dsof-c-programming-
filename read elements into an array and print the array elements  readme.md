Overview
This program demonstrates how to read elements into an array and print the array elements using the C programming language. It is a fundamental program used to understand array input/output operations.

Algorithm
Read the number of elements n.
Declare an array of size n.
Read n elements from the user and store them in the array.
Traverse the array using a loop.
Print each element of the array.

Program Logic

Uses a for loop to read array elements.
Uses another for loop to print array elements.
Helps in understanding indexing and traversal.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Input

Number of elements in the array
Elements of the array (integers)

Example Input
5
10 20 30 40 50

Output

Displays all the elements of the array
Example Output
Array elements are:
10 20 30 40 50
