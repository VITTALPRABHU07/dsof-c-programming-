 Shift All Zeros to the End (C Program)

 Overview
This program demonstrates how to **shift all zero elements to the end of an array** while **maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements**.  
It uses an **efficient in-place approach** with linear time complexity.

This is a **commonly asked interview problem** and an important concept in **array manipulation**.



Objective
- Move all `0` values to the end of the array
- Preserve the order of non-zero elements
- Perform the operation in-place
- Practice efficient array traversal logic



 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** code ::blocks  
- **Platform:** Windows 


 Logic Used
- Traverse the array once
- Copy all non-zero elements to the front
- Count the number of non-zero elements
- Fill the remaining positions with zeros

This approach avoids unnecessary swapping and ensures **stable output**.


Program Features
- Preserves order of non-zero elements
- Single-pass traversal
- In-place modification (no extra memory)
- Clean and modular code structure
- Interview-ready solution

 Topics Covered
- Array traversal
- Conditional logic
- In-place array manipulation
- Time and space complexity
- Interview-based array problems
