Check if Two Arrays Are Equal (C Program)

 Overview
This program checks whether **two arrays are equal**.  
Two arrays are considered equal if they:
- Have the **same number of elements**
- Contain **identical elements in the same order**

The program uses a **linear comparison approach** and follows **industrial coding standards**.


 Objective
- Compare two arrays element by element
- Verify equality based on size and order
- Practice efficient array traversal
- Strengthen fundamentals of C programming

 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** code :: blocks  
- **Platform:** Windows 


 Topics Covered
- Array declaration and initialization
- Array traversal
- Element-wise comparison
- Conditional statements
- Time and space complexity

 Brief Self-Reflection
This program helped me understand how to **compare arrays efficiently using a linear approach**.  
It improved my ability to analyze **edge cases** and strengthened my understanding of **array traversal and comparison logic** in C.

Working on this program enhanced my **problem-solving skills** and prepared me for **interview-based array questions**.
