Find the difference between two arrays (element-wise)

 Element-wise Difference Between Two Arrays in C
Description
This program computes the element-wise difference between two integer arrays of the same size.
Each element of the result array is calculated as:

difference[i] = array1[i] - array2[i]
The program takes input from the user, performs validation, and displays the resulting difference array.

Objectives

To understand array operations in C
To perform element-wise subtraction
To practice user input handling
To follow industrial coding standards

 Concepts Covered

One-dimensional arrays
Element-wise array operations
for loops
Input validation
Use of macros (#define)
Clean and readable code structure

 Technologies Used

Programming Language: C
Compiler: code::block
Platform: Windows 

 Program Flow

Read the number of elements
Validate array size
Read elements of the first array
Read elements of the second array
Compute element-wise difference
Display the resulting array

 Sample Input
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter elements of first array:
10 20 30 40 50
Enter elements of second array:
1 2 3 4 5

 Sample Output
Difference array (arr1 - arr2):
9 18 27 36 45

 Learning Outcomes

Learned how to perform element-wise array subtraction
Improved understanding of array indexing
Practiced writing industrial-standard C code
Gained confidence in handling user input and validation

 Future Enhancements

Absolute difference between arrays
Difference using pointers
Dynamic memory allocation using malloc
Menu-driven array operations

Conclusion
This program demonstrates a simple and effective approach to calculating the element-wise difference between two arrays in C.
