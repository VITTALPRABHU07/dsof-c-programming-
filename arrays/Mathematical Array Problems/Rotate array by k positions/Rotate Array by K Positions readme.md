 Rotate Array by K Positions (C Program)

 Overview
This program demonstrates how to **rotate an array by `k` positions** using the C programming language.  
The rotation is performed **in-place** without using extra memory and follows **industry-standard coding practices**.

The program supports **right rotation** and properly handles cases where `k` is greater than the array size.


 Objective
- Rotate an array by `k` positions
- Understand array manipulation logic
- Practice modular and readable C programming
- Handle edge cases efficiently


 Technologies Used
- Language: **C**
- Compiler: **code::blocks**
- Platform: **Windows **


 Logic Used
- Normalize rotation value using `k = k % n`
- Perform right rotation by moving the last element to the front
- Repeat the process `k` times
- Use helper functions for better readability

 Program Features
- Simple and readable code
- Modular function-based design
- Handles large values of `k`
- In-place rotation (no extra memory)

 Topics Covered
-Array basics in C
-Array traversal techniques
-Rotation of array by k positions
-Right rotation logic
-Handling edge cases (k > n)
-In-place array manipulation
-Time and space complexity analysis
-Modular programming using functions
