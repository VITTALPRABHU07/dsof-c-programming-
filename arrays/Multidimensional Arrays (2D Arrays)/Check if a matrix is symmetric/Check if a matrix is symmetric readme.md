Check if a Matrix is Symmetric (C Program)
Description

This program checks whether a given square matrix is symmetric.
A matrix is said to be symmetric if it is equal to its transpose, i.e.,

The user enters the matrix size and elements, and the program verifies and displays whether the matrix is symmetric or not.

Objectives

To understand the concept of symmetric matrices
To work with square matrices using 2D arrays
To compare matrix elements logically
To practice nested loops and conditional statements

Concepts Covered
Two-dimensional arrays
Square matrices
Matrix symmetry
Nested for loops
Conditional statements (if)
User input using scanf

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Compiler: Code::Blocks
Platform: Windows

Program Flow
Read matrix size (rows and columns)
Validate whether the matrix is square
Read elements of the matrix
Compare each element A[i][j] with A[j][i]
If all corresponding elements are equal, the matrix is symmetric
Display whether the matrix is symmetric or not

Sample Input
Enter number of rows and columns: 3 3

Enter matrix elements:
1 2 3
2 4 5
3 5 6

Sample Output
The matrix is symmetric

Learning Outcomes

Understood the definition of a symmetric matrix
Learned how to compare matrix elements efficiently
Improved understanding of nested loops
Gained confidence in matrix-based logical checks

Future Enhancements

Display the transpose of the matrix
Support for dynamic memory allocation using malloc
Function-based implementation
Menu-driven matrix operations

Conclusion

This program demonstrates a clear and effective method to check whether a matrix is symmetric using C language.
It is ideal for beginners, academic laboratory exercises, and interview preparation, strengthening concepts related to matrices and array manipulation.
