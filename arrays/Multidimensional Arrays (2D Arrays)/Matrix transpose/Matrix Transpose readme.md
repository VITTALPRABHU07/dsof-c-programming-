Matrix Transpose 
Description

This program reads the elements of a matrix from the user and computes the transpose of the matrix.
The transpose is obtained by converting rows into columns and columns into rows.
It uses two-dimensional arrays and nested loops to perform the transpose operation.

Objectives

To understand matrix transpose using 2D arrays
To read matrix elements from the user
To interchange rows and columns of a matrix
To practice nested loops

Concepts Covered

Two-dimensional arrays
Matrix transpose
Reading input using scanf
Printing output using printf
Nested for loops

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Compiler: Code::Blocks
Platform: Windows

Program Flow
Read number of rows and columns
Read elements of the matrix
Store elements in a 2D array
Compute transpose by swapping rows and columns
Print the transposed matrix

Sample Input
Enter number of rows and columns: 2 3

Enter elements of the matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Sample Output
Transpose of the matrix:
1 4
2 5
3 6

Learning Outcomes
Understood how matrix transpose works
Learned to use two-dimensional arrays effectively
Improved understanding of row and column manipulation
Strengthened skills in nested loop usage

Future Enhancements
Support for dynamic matrix size
Transpose without using an extra matrix
Menu-driven matrix operations
Integration with other matrix operations

Conclusion
This program demonstrates a simple and effective method to compute the transpose of a matrix using C language.
It is suitable for beginners, academic laboratory work, and practice sessions.
