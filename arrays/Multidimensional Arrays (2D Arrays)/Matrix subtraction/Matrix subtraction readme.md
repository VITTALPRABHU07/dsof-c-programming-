Matrix Subtraction Program in C

Description
This program performs matrix subtraction for square matrices of size 1×1, 2×2, or 3×3.
The user selects the matrix size, enters elements for two matrices, and the program computes and displays the difference matrix.

Objectives

To understand matrix representation using 2D arrays
To perform subtraction of two matrices
To practice nested loops
To handle user-defined matrix size

Concepts Covered
Two-dimensional arrays
Matrix subtraction
Nested for loops
Conditional statements (if)
User input using scanf
Basic input validation

Technologies Used

Programming Language: C
Compiler: Code::Blocks
Platform: Windows


Program Flow
Read matrix size (n)
Validate matrix size (only 1, 2, or 3 allowed)
Read elements of Matrix A
Read elements of Matrix B
Subtract corresponding elements of both matrices
Display the resultant matrix

Sample Input
Enter matrix size (1 for 1x1, 2 for 2x2, 3 for 3x3): 2

Enter elements of Matrix A (2x2):
5 6
7 8

Enter elements of Matrix B (2x2):
1 2
3 4

Sample Output
Resultant Matrix (A - B):
4 4
4 4

Learning Outcomes
Understood how to work with square matrices
Learned element-wise matrix subtraction
Improved skills in using nested loops
Gained confidence in 2D array manipulation

Future Enhancements
Support for any matrix size
Dynamic memory allocation using malloc
Matrix addition and multiplication
Menu-driven matrix operations

Conclusion

This program demonstrates a simple and effective approach to subtracting two square matrices using C language.
It is suitable for beginners, academic laboratory work, and interview preparation.
