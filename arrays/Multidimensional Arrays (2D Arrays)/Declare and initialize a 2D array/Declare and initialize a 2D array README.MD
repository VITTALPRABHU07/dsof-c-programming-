 2D Array Input Program in C
 Description

This program demonstrates how to declare a 2D array, take user input for the number of rows and columns, read matrix elements, and display the matrix using the C programming language.
The program follows industrial coding standards with proper validation and readability.

 Objectives

To understand 2D array declaration
To take dynamic-sized input using fixed maximum limits
To practice nested loops
To display matrix elements in row-column format

 Concepts Covered

Two-dimensional arrays
User input using scanf
Nested for loops
Macros (#define)
Input validation
Memory-safe programming practices

Technologies Used

Programming Language: C
Compiler: CODE::BLOCK
Platform: Windows

Program Flow

Define maximum allowed rows and columns using macros
Take user input for number of rows and columns
Validate input values
Read matrix elements using nested loops
Display the entered matrix

 Sample Input
Enter number of rows: 2
Enter number of columns: 3
Enter 6 elements:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Sample Output
Matrix Elements:
1 2 3
4 5 6


Learning Outcomes

Gained hands-on experience with 2D arrays
Learned how to manage user-defined dimensions
Improved understanding of industrial coding practices
Developed confidence in handling matrix-based problems

Future Enhancements

Dynamic memory allocation using malloc
Matrix operations (addition, transpose, multiplication)
Error handling for invalid data input
Menu-driven matrix programs

 Conclusion
This program provides a clear and structured approach to handling 2D arrays with user input in C.
It is suitable for academic learning, interview preparation, and real-world coding standards.
