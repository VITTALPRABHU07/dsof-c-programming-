Matrix Multiplication Program in C
Description

This program performs matrix multiplication for two compatible matrices of user-defined size.
The user enters the dimensions and elements of two matrices, and the program computes and displays the resultant matrix after multiplication.

Objectives

To understand matrix representation using 2D arrays
To perform matrix multiplication using nested loops
To apply mathematical rules of matrix multiplication
To practice user input handling and validation

Concepts Covered
Two-dimensional arrays
Matrix multiplication logic
Nested for loops
Conditional statements (if)
User input using scanf
Basic input validation

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Compiler: Code::Blocks
Platform: Windows

Program Flow

Read rows and columns of Matrix A
Read rows and columns of Matrix B
Validate multiplication condition (columns of A = rows of B)
Read elements of Matrix A
Read elements of Matrix B
Initialize the result matrix
Multiply matrices using nested loops
Display the resultant matrix

Sample Input
Enter rows and columns of Matrix A: 2 3
Enter rows and columns of Matrix B: 3 2

Enter elements of Matrix A:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Enter elements of Matrix B:
7 8
9 10
11 12

Sample Output
Resultant Matrix:
58 64
139 154

Learning Outcomes

Understood the rules of matrix multiplication
Learned how to multiply two matrices element-wise using loops
Improved understanding of nested loops
Gained confidence in handling 2D arrays in C

Future Enhancements

Support for dynamic matrix sizes
Use of dynamic memory allocation (malloc)
Function-based implementation
Menu-driven matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)

Conclusion

This program demonstrates a clear and structured approach to matrix multiplication using C language.
It is suitable for beginners, academic laboratory exercises, and interview preparation, helping build a strong foundation in matrix operations and array manipulation.
