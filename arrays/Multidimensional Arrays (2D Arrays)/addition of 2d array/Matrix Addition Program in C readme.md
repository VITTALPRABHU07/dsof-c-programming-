 Matrix Addition Program in C 
 Description

This program performs matrix addition for square matrices of size 1×1, 2×2, or 3×3.
The user selects the matrix size, enters elements for two matrices, and the program computes and displays their sum matrix.

 Objectives

To understand matrix representation using 2D arrays
To perform addition of two matrices
To practice nested loops
To handle user-defined matrix size

Concepts Covered

Two-dimensional arrays
Matrix addition
Nested for loops
Conditional statements (if)
User input using scanf
Basic input validation

Technologies Used

Programming Language: C
Compiler: code::block
Platform: Windows 

 Program Flow

Read matrix size (n)
Validate matrix size (only 1, 2, or 3 allowed)
Read elements of Matrix A
Read elements of Matrix B
Add corresponding elements of both matrices
Display the resultant matrix

 Sample Input
Enter matrix size (1 for 1x1, 2 for 2x2, 3 for 3x3): 2

Enter elements of Matrix A (2x2):
1 2
3 4

Enter elements of Matrix B (2x2):
5 6
7 8

 Sample Output
Resultant Matrix (A + B):
6 8
10 12

 Learning Outcomes

Understood how to work with square matrices
Learned element-wise matrix addition
Improved skills in using nested loops
Gained confidence in 2D array manipulation


Future Enhancements

Support for any matrix size
Dynamic memory allocation using malloc
Matrix subtraction and multiplication
Menu-driven matrix operations

 Conclusion

This program demonstrates a simple and effective approach to adding two square matrices using C.
It is ideal for beginners, academic labs, and interview preparation.
