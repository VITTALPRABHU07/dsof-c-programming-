Find the Largest Element in a Matrix (C Program)
Description

This program finds the largest element in a given matrix using C programming.
The user enters the matrix size and elements, and the program scans all elements to determine and display the maximum value present in the matrix.

Objectives
To understand matrix representation using 2D arrays
To find the largest element in a matrix
To practice nested loops
To work with comparison operations

Concepts Covered
Two-dimensional arrays
Nested for loops
Conditional statements (if)
User input using scanf
Basic comparison logic

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Compiler: Code::Blocks
Platform: Windows

Program Flow
Read number of rows and columns
Read elements of the matrix
Assume the first element as the largest
Compare each element with the current largest value
Update the largest value when a bigger element is found
Display the largest element

Sample Input
Enter number of rows and columns: 3 3

Enter matrix elements:
2 8 4
1 6 9
5 3 7

Sample Output
Largest element in the matrix = 9

Learning Outcomes
Understood how to work with matrices using 2D arrays
Learned how to find the maximum value in a matrix
Improved skills in nested loop implementation
Gained confidence in matrix traversal

Future Enhancements
Find both largest and smallest elements
Support for dynamic matrix size using malloc
Function-based implementation
Menu-driven matrix operations

Conclusion

This program demonstrates a simple and efficient approach to finding the largest element in a matrix using C language.
