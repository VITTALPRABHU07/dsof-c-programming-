Read and Print a Matrix in C

Description
This program reads the elements of a matrix from the user and prints the matrix in row and column format.
It uses two-dimensional arrays and nested loops to store and display matrix elements.

Objectives

To understand matrix representation using 2D arrays
To read matrix elements from the user
To display the matrix in proper format
To practice nested loops

Concepts Covered

Two-dimensional arrays
Reading input using scanf
Printing output using printf
Nested for loops

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Compiler: Code::Blocks
Platform: Windows

Program Flow

Print the matrix in row-wise format

Sample Input
Enter number of rows and columns: 2 3

Enter elements of the matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Sample Output
Matrix elements are:
1 2 3
4 5 6
