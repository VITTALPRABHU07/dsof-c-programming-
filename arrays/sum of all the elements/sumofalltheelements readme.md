Sum of Elements in an Array
Overview

Finding the sum of elements in an array is a basic operation in programming. It involves adding all the elements of the array to obtain a single total value.

This operation is commonly used in data processing, statistics, and numerical computations.

 How It Works

Initialize a variable to store the sum.

Traverse the array from the first element to the last.

Add each element to the sum variable.

After all elements are processed, the sum variable contains the total.

 Algorithm Steps

Read the number of elements in the array.

Read all the array elements.

Initialize the sum variable to zero.

Add each array element to the sum.

Display the final sum.

⏱️ Time Complexity

O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

 Space Complexity

O(1), since no extra memory is required.

 Advantages

Simple and easy to implement

Useful for many mathematical operations

Works for all types of numeric arrays

 Disadvantages

Not suitable for very large numbers without proper data types

Requires traversal of the entire array

Applications

Calculating total marks or scores

Finding total sales or revenue

Statistical analysis like average calculation

Data aggregation tasks

 Conclusion

Calculating the sum of elements in an array is a fundamental programming task. It helps in understanding array traversal and basic arithmetic operations, making it essential for beginners.
